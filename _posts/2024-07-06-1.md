wow another blog post in a week! i remember the time back when netblox used to have custom rendered
studs, using raylib's default function and some ✨pythagorean theorem✨ to limit the distance to the
camera. 

back then there was no such thing as DataModel, about existance of i should have been aware.
also back then netblox's scripting was buggy asf and it was built upon LuaHandle objects, that reference
Instances and runtime would somehow use them, and they were the main source of my issues, primarily
it would cause major memory leaks.

i cried so fucking much trying to remove them, and i succeddeed (how tf do you spell this).

moral of this story: dont fucking give up you stoneman slut (sry)
